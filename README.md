# UnityMazeScripts
A repo for scripts for my learning project in unity

Currently I'm thinking of working on:
-A script to translate the pixel space of an image to a maze
-A script to generate a semi randomic maze/procedurally generated mazes
-A pathfinding script to direct a character through the navigation of a maze (towards an exit or any point of interest)

The script may or may not be optimized or finished
